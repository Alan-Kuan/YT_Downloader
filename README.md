# YT Downloader

![YT Downloader Logo](/assets/Logo.png)

## Introduction
This is a simple GUI for a Python package, youtube-dl. It was made for my own usage first; however, I thought I could share it and decided to push it here.  
Since, it was for my personal usage, it only provides functionality of downloading a video on YouTube with format of `.mp4`, or encoding it into an audio file with format `.mp3`.

## Requirements
* Python
* youtube-dl
* PyQt5
* ffmpeg  (for encoding a video into an audio)

## Instation & Usage
1. Git clone the repo, download with a zip file, or whatever method you like to pull the files.
2. Make sure `main.py`, `interface.ui`, and `assets/` are at the same directory.
3. Execute the `main.py` and enjoy it!

## Tested Platform
* Windows 10
* Debian 10 (Buster)
